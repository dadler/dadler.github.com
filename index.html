<h1>Thumbnail Zoom Plus --- David Adler</h1>
<p>
Thumbnail Zoom Plus is a Firefox plug-in which shows the full image when you hover over a thumbnail.  
Thumbnail Zoom Plus is an enhanced version of the original Thumbnail Zoom add-on 
(which was written by Andres Hernandez).
<br /><br />
When you hover your mouse over a thumbnail or a link to an image or YouTube video, 
the add-on displays the full-size image or video still-frame in a floating window.  
The image remains visible until you move the mouse or click the image.  
This makes it easy to move the mouse from one thumbnail to another to see the 
corresponding full-size images.
<br /><br />
Supported sites include Facebook, Twitter, Twitpic, MySpace, LinkedIn, Hi5,
Amazon, Picasa, Flickr, Tagged, PhotoBucket, deviantART, Last.fm, Wikipedia, 
IMDb, YouTube, Daily Mile, Engadget, Imgur, and Photosight.  The add-on's 
preferences and toolbar menu let you enable or disable these sites as desired.
<br /><br />
The add-on also supports any site which links directly to image files, imgur pages, or 
YouTube videos, including Reddit and many others (this is enabled by the "Others" checkbox 
in the add-on's preferences).
<br /><br />
You can also select "Download Enlarged Image" from the context menu to save the 
full-size image to disk.
<br /><br />
Note: This plug-in is incompatible with the original Thumbnail Zoom add-on; 
Remove or Disable it before using Thumbnail Zoom Plus.
